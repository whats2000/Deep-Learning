12,@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
13,@USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason.
14,@USAirways Can you provide me with info about checking strollers and car seats?  Costs?  Restrictions?  Need to bring 2 seats 1 stroller.
15,@SouthwestAir Does anyone ever answer your phone? #poor
16,@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-)

25,"@JetBlue if there is a ""processing error"" the  why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations? #FlySouthwest"
26,@united my bag is a few days Late Flight to me and this is like the 3rd time in the past couple months.  Where my free miles at?!
27,@USAirways @Expedia 7 Hours for my friend to rebook his trip to Korea after @USAirways Cancelled Flightled a connecting flight to Chicago = IDIOTIC.
28,@USAirways I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates??
29,"@USAirways What is with your lost &amp; found.  My wife lost her phone in Philly, &amp; followed your web instructions to call an 800#.  No answer."

42,"@SouthwestAir that's gotta be a new record: 4 hrs in the air, 11 hrs waiting and 0 bags delivered to destination."
43,@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
44,"@united Surprised to go from 1K last year to nothing this year. What happened to the ""soft landing"" policy of no more than 1 level?"
45,@JetBlue there's is nothing there because apparently I have to connect them for that to be true.

59,@SouthwestAir well I HAD a car &amp
60,@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp
61,"@JetBlue you are missing the point. The flight left an hour Late Flight. Why are you allowed to be that Late Flight, and still charge me $50 and 10hrs?"
62,"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
63,@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
64,@united Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United?
65,@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail
66,@JetBlue I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it's too Late Flight for that!
67,"@JetBlue awesome, thanks!"
68,@united severely under staffed at Iah.

80,@AmericanAir Can you provide guidance on how I should work with them to resolve the issue
81,"@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding."
82,"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
83,"@SouthwestAir Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, &amp; I remain a LOYAL SW customer!"
84,"@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee"
85,@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
86,@VirginAmerica What @dhepburn said.

109,"@united thats weak. See ya üëã
Hey @VirginAmerica !!"
110,@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
111,@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
112,@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
113,@SouthwestAir Why won't you let me leave Newark!?
114,@AmericanAir I took the day off from work and drove 9 hours round trip to rescue my daughter and 3 other students from LaGuardia. Thanks!
115,@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA

131,@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
132,"@united is pri boarding for ""Active Military"" or only ""In Uniform?"" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel"
133,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
134,@AmericanAir does it show that we are on the same plane?
135,"@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them."
136,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest

138,"@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?"

140,@SouthwestAir No worries at all!!! I would rather be safe on the ground than take any chances. Yes! Tomorrow AM if BNA reopens ‚ò∫Ô∏è
141,@JetBlue sounds fun! How does that work?
142,@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
143,"@VirginAmerica has getaway deals through May, from $59 one-way. Lots of cool cities http://t.co/tZZJhuIbCH #CheapFlights #FareCompare"
144,"@SouthwestAir is it possible to add travel arranged by my employer to my upcoming travel? I can retrieve a reservation, but that's it."
145,"@JetBlue yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled."

147,@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
148,@USAirways why have me board a plane knowing there is a maint issue?  US5235.
149,"@USAirways sucks. Delayed my mom's flight 2X, Cancelled Flightled it, delayed her flight again today,all for mech. issues.She had 2 sleep in airport!"

153,@AmericanAir the Late Flightst usair4603. Earlier 4591

155,@USAirways Sending thanks to employee Freddie in PHL Admiral Club A East for allowing me to give a day pass to my sibling stuck there today.
156,@VirginAmerica check out new music http://t.co/maRcnOCWzn
157,@VirginAmerica - Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable
158,@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
159,@USAirways waiting all day at ATL since flight this am Cancelled Flightled. 1 standby told no seats and group of 15 shows up Late Flight and gets on to PHL
160,@USAirways #Unbelievable that for 2 consecutive days I can't get through to a person.  On hold over 2 hours and still going
161,@SouthwestAir Flight Booking Problems all my Late Flight summer travel! Did the AUS-CUN direct flight disappear?
162,@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
163,"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"
164,@AmericanAir Lady at B1 ABQ for 5347 on 2/23 was of a great service to all among several Cancelled Flightlations
165,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
166,@united service staff to is less than friendly!
167,@USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
168,"@AmericanAir because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim."
169,"@VirginAmerica thanks for that. Been needing a way to make those Austin trips from DCA, and now you've come through!"
170,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
171,Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
172,"@VirginAmerica Anytime, sugafly."
173,@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp
174,@USAirways Well I did miss it. But gate agents had rebooked boarding pass waiting when I landed. Time for lunch &amp
175,"@AmericanAir 3231DTW to LAG at 4:45. Flight Cancelled Flightled with no notice. Given a voucher to a dirty hotel, with no food vouchers or apology."

177,@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
178,"@VirginAmerica Dear Virgin customer, while you're stranded in SF for 3 days &amp; $1000cost- we'll do the very least we can to accommodate you!"
179,@VirginAmerica New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think?
180,@united I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class?  There were 5 empty coach seats near me?  I'm a Premier 1K?
181,@SouthwestAir is there a way to DM you?
182,"@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD"
183,"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
184,@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
185,@SouthwestAir sat on a plane for 2+ hrs on 2/15! Then we finally took off.. :(
186,@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
187,"@VirginAmerica Done, but I need the receipt ASAP. Could you please help? #150219-000114"
188,"@USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now!"

190,"@USAirways first, luggage got stuck in a different city, now I get them back today &amp; one of your employees stole a pair of gloves from me!"
191,@USAirways why won't you help me get my luggage back? I'm a teen trying to change the world in DC #Flight5182 #usairways
192,@USAirways I need someone from management to contact me I was flying to a funeral won't make it now to add to my pain they want me 2 pay
193,"@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable."
194,@USAirways I was on hold for 2 hours and still no answer. Is this really how you run your business? http://t.co/P8xFhq4kps
195,@AmericanAir @dfwairport me too!!  LOVE LIVING SO CLOSE SO I ALWAYS HAVE GREAT VIEWS!
196,"@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open
-- My request to merge the accounts is denied"
197,@united I want a hotel room and a whiskey.
198,@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..üò°...
199,@USAirways @AmericanAir  Also your on-hold message is trying to sell Valentines Day gifts.  Over a week Late Flight.  Sounds about right for USAir
200,"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won‚Äôt fix it."
201,"@SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch."
202,"@SouthwestAir That was Chantilly, Paris, France."
203,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
204,@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
205,@SouthwestAir happy to enter your sweepstakes again #nutsaboutsouthwest
206,"@SouthwestAir flight to BOS Cancelled Flightled, no flights till TUESDAY, spent $1000 to get a flight through another airline + $170 for hotel. Refund"
207,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
208,"@united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead"
209,@JetBlue Apparently the pilot had made some announcement about engine trouble and losing fuel too quickly.
210,@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
211,"@AmericanAir If you care, could you have someone call me to explain what is going on."
212,"@AmericanAir stop sending me back to ""customer relations ""I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!"
213,"@AmericanAir yes, I will do just that as soon as I have a moment to gather my thoughts."
214,@united exactly
215,@USAirways They're all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult.
216,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
217,@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
218,@SouthwestAir Can my wife's RR points be transferred to my RR account?
219,@SouthwestAir would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation
220,"@JetBlue  thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn't be so bad but airport is closed!"
221,@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
222,@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
223,"@VirginAmerica @LadyGaga @CarrieUnderwood Sorry, Mary Martin had it first!"
224,@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
225,@united Hi! what is the phone number for reservations in Venezuela? Thanks
226,@AmericanAir Can you upgrade (with cash) to Main Cabin Extra after buying an AAdvantage Mileage Saver (using miles)? Can't seem to do it...
227,@united hey! think someone could meet me with my book when I arrive at @loganairports at 10:30? It's yes please #amypoehler. Oscar took it.
228,@SouthwestAir @heavenlychc9 I'd at least enjoy a free cocktail...or two.
229,@JetBlue Thanks! See you soon!
230,@AmericanAir What's the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful.
231,@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
232,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
233,"@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better"
234,@SouthwestAir my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time?
235,"@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in."
236,"@USAirways if you mean by posted, no USAir empl to direct anyone, 800# not accepting calls, no contact from USAir re: rebook #greatjob"
237,@USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp
238,@VirginAmerica I'm pulling my hair out trying to book a flight with u. Your site doesn't work on iPhone or iPad.don't have a computer #help
239,@SouthwestAir we're pulling off the runway now! Making new friends with seat mates. Thanks for the response CB.
240,@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
241,@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can‚Äôt fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
242,@JetBlue 2324 from Orlando to Dca ! And my awesome flight attendant is Robert!
243,@southwestair How can I refer a friend for the Southwest Credit card for points?
244,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
245,@JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
246,@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
247,@JetBlue which type plane is flt 1065 from bos to rsw?
248,@SouthwestAir Got it covered. Thanks!
249,@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
250,@JetBlue I‚Äôm going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome
251,@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
252,@USAirways very embarrassing.
253,@USAirways next time you promise an ontime departure you should stick to it instead of stuffing us in this sweat box with no air

667,"@SouthwestAir Password reset email is incredibly slow to arrive today. Checked spam folder, too. Web site says a few minutes, but 15? :|"

748,"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
749,@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
750,"@JetBlue just a heads up, this page no longer exists http://t.co/NsJWVTTjGo"
751,@AmericanAir How do I change my flight if the phone system keeps telling me that the representatives are busy?
752,@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
753,@USAirways - 800# referred me back to baggage services but I left the airport. I was on seat 17A
754,@JetBlue Thank you so much!  I wasn't sure since in know the limit is 4 ozs. Excited to fly with JetBlue!
755,@SouthwestAir can u get me on flt #3768 instead of #2522 rt now
756,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
757,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
758,@USAirways What's the seat assignment policy? Why let us choose a seat only to change it on us two weeks Late Flightr?
759,@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
760,@SouthwestAir baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler
761,@AmericanAir appreciate it!!
762,.@AmericanAir Hopefully it's all fixed. They've got a new aircraft for us- just waiting to board.
763,"@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!"
764,"@USAirways paid to upgrade to first class, went up to Admirals club at PHX airport to be turned away because our flight is to CUN and not MC"

776,@JetBlue weather where?  It's 60 in SFO and flight 834 is still on time to boston.
777,@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!

805,@SouthwestAir No. We were in a large group. Majority of the 30+ bags were soaked.

824,@JetBlue i deleted that tweet because one of your wonderful employees swooped in to help--faith restored. You are one of the good ones. üëç
825,@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
826,@JetBlue #1680 Super smooth flight and landing. Nicely done.
827,"@JetBlue yes, today. Flight is full now. They said no to me at gate :("

834,@USAirways claims flight Cancelled Flighted due to weather at destination but Delta has not Cancelled Flighted flight on same route.
835,@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.
836,@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
837,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
838,@USAirways What a great way to kick someone when they are down. Cancelled Flight a noon flight and rebook me on one two hours south from here tomorrow
839,@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
840,"@AmericanAir you bet make this screw up right (for once). Things I need in bag for my job and you have ""grounded"" me today #painandsuffering"
841,@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short

848,@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
849,@united yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow morning. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go.

1259,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?

1269,"@SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?"
1270,@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
1271,@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD
1272,@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
1273,@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.

 Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag."

1489,@USAirways where's my apology?
1490,@JetBlue I do! The best airline wifi ever. Thank you!
1491,@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!

1520,@SouthwestAir heyo! What is causing flight 1836 ewr to hou to be delayed?
1521,@united one hour after departure time and still no update!

1525,@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
1526,@JetBlue I'm all set. About to fly. Not bad for a first date with a giant metal bird machine. She even brought snacks.
1527,@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
1528,@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well

1535,@USAirways I fucking hate your customer service. I've been on hold all morning trying to figure out why you Cancelled Flighted my flight.
1536,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp
1537,"@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?"

1556,@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
1557,@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
1558,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
1559,@AmericanAir I FOUND MY FOOTAGE!! :D I am so so happy.
1560,"@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!"

1580,@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
1581,@AmericanAir I booked it on US Airways site. Don't see a Cancelled Flight link :(
1582,@SouthwestAir here we go again. Delayed in Chicago why offer the 630 flight if you never intend to fly it
1583,"@AmericanAir We did talk with Delta for about hour over phone, and I got a number from Delta that they asked to give to AA, which I did."

1587,@AmericanAir there was also not one single person at the counter answering questions for our plane full of confused people. No staff at all.
1588,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
1589,@USAirways never flying you guys again. your customer service is awful
1590,@JetBlue Will do. Thanks!
1591,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."

1599,@USAirways getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles.
1600,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
1601,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
1602,"@AmericanAir 45min wait to get de-iced in Tulsa.Not good service.Looks like everyone will miss connections, not due to weather. Fight is on"
1603,@SouthwestAir So I guess you can get to the airport too early!  Need to wait 10mins to checkin. Really?

1605,"@USAirways She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren't medical equipment and that she should have ""planned better."""

1658,"@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?"

1662,@SouthwestAir #RedCarpet Southwest Companion Pass would be great!
1663,@JetBlue so happy you can accommodate peanut/treenut allergies on flight! 1st online cover from air provider
1664,"@united A3 Gold. So the international baggage limit apply when booked on 1 ticket,even for a domestic leg?  What if I travel with 2 friends?"
1665,@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
1666,"@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
1667,"@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability"

1669,@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
1670,"@SouthwestAir Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position."
1671,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
1672,@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
1673,@USAirways- can you tell me what the policy is for preboarding with small children? Is that still a thing?
1674,"@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it"
1675,@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
1676,"@SouthwestAir its all good. flight eventually took off, and landed safely. oh, and I got the free cup o wine. thx"
1677,@JetBlue Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks.
1678,@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.

1707,"@SouthwestAir Yes - with extra $77. I wonder what are you going yo loose, if there is room."
1708,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
1709,@JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer.
1710,@united Thanks JT

1733,@AmericanAir *does = doesn't
1734,@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
1735,@AmericanAir Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway.
1736,@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
1737,"@JetBlue When chging flight, isit possible to pay the fare difference in dollars when the ticket was bought completely via point redemption?"

1739,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
1740,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
1741,"@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?"
1742,@united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
1743,"@united as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations"

1746,@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
1747,@USAirways Your customer service line keeps telling me call back Late Flightr and disconnects. How can I talk to someone about my flight?
1748,@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.

1958,"@SouthwestAir so, when your plane doesn't work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model."
1959,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
1960,@AmericanAir first my sister had ZERO food in her cross country flight with no type of warning or voucher
1961,@JetBlue excellent. you guys are the best
1962,@JetBlue OK cool.  I need to listen to some Dre and Snoop en route to LA.  That would have been a shame.
1963,"@VirginAmerica what happened to direct flights from SFO-FLL? Looking in May, only see connecting #help #dontdothistome"
1964,@AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate!
1965,@united I sent you a dm hours ago
1966,@USAirways will all flights out of DFW be Cancelled Flightled today?
1967,@SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?
1968,"@JetBlue unfortunately no, but hoping I can catch one sometime in the near future!"
1969,@JetBlue there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy
1970,@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
1971,@JetBlue well I'm not sure I'm that bold! lol or are you saying you didn't believe me?? :P
1972,"@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn‚Äôt a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now"

2012,@united #epicfail on #CX as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay
2013,@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
2014,@VirginAmerica please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it's on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas
2015,@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?

2080,@JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It‚Äôs a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.

2148,@USAirways Its pretty ridiculous that at PHX sky harbor you have 4 (!) employees working check in on a SUNDAY afternoon. 30 min &amp
2149,@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
2150,@VirginAmerica is helping me step up my @Tinder game! #TinderTips #tinderchamp http://t.co/jBmVVha63A
2151,@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
2152,@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
2153,"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
2154,@USAirways my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks

2160,@JetBlue will I be charged a fee to do so?
2161,@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
2162,@SouthwestAir LUVed the SJC gate 23 agent this am who boarded flight 372 to DAL. Didn't get his name. He represents your brand so well.
2163,@SouthwestAir Any idea why TSA Pre-Check isn't showing for my next flight tomorrow? The number is in my profile...
2164,@malhoit at least you got a response from @AmericanAir via Twitter. I went 0 for 2 yesterday.
2165,@united that's cool - now what?
2166,@USAirways I've been on hold for over 90 minutes... There's a lack of quality service here.  Nobody cares that I hate your shitty airline.
2167,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
2168,@united done as requested.
2169,@united any news?
2170,"@AmericanAir Yes, but should be able to get a push notification via the app if I‚Äôm logged in and on a trip. Email/text is so 2010 üò•."
2171,@united There is only one club at LAX  - in terminal 7 across from gate 71
2172,@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
2173,@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
2174,@SouthwestAir where was the inclement weather? Other flights left DCA today and this plane appeared to be coming from AUS.
2175,"@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service"
2176,@SouthwestAir Had a great trip this past week to Vegas for work
2177,"@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner."
2178,@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.

2186,@SouthwestAir still planing on flights into Dal? We are trying to fly in tomorrow from lax
2187,"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"

2217,@AmericanAir it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.
2218,@AmericanAir speaking 2 languages paid off! as the US line left me over 70 min in hold -without an answer- the latinamerican solved in 20min
2219,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.

2233,@JetBlue extra-speed line closed in Tampa. What gives?
2234,"@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that..."

2436,@VirginAmerica  Flight Booking Problems last second flight for next week from SFO- to SAN any chance you want to gift me a promo code since I love you guys
2437,"@JetBlue may I check my 17-month-old child's fold-up crib for free on my flight tomorrow, similar to your policy for infant car seats?"
2438,"@USAirways Cancelled Flights my flight to NY 3 times, then once I make it here they decided for S&amp;Gs they'll Cancelled Flight my return flight too. Thanks."
2439,@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
2440,"@SouthwestAir I saw ppl were winning tickets still, how do we win some?"
2441,@SouthwestAir Flight 3111 (N614SW) departs @MCO enroute to Indianapolis International Airport http://t.co/qefKFWZo7d
2442,"@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!"
2443,"@VirginAmerica is the best airline I have flown on.Easy to change your reservation,helpful representatives &amp; a comfortable flying experience"
2444,@VirginAmerica and it's a really big bad thing about it
2445,@USAirways once again your company actualy put people in weird situations.Your hostel voucher was fake.Snow is ok but no lies please
2446,@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - @TheVDT http://t.co/h6cE3mWCqj
2447,@SouthwestAir Is there anyway to pay more to get priority boarding A 1-15?
2448,@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
2449,"@USAirways 24 hrs Late Flightr still not home. Hotel, rental car etc with a 5 yr old, what happened to ""customer service is our first priority"""
2450,@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
2451,"@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium."
2452,"@JetBlue thanks for getting me to Boston early for @TuftsEnergyConf ""Breaking Barriers To a Clean Energy Future"""
2453,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
2454,@USAirways XNA has TSA Precheck! Would be nice if your system knew that.
2455,"@AmericanAir My bag flew with AA while I flew with Delta, and I'm still not sure whose final carrier is referred to."
2456,"@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more"
2457,@JetBlue when will you release flights for February 2016?
2458,"@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags"
2459,@SouthwestAir Left my computer on the plane. Two weeks Late Flightr they found it and sent it to me. #greatservice.  #happy #customer
2460,@united question. Are departure times based off eastern central time or the time zone your actually in?
2461,"@AmericanAir and @CVGairport get it together, perfect combination for delays and Cancelled Flightlations"
2462,@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
2463,"@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate."
2464,@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
2465,@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
2466,@USAirways thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay.
2467,"@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures"
2468,@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
2469,@SouthwestAir The Opal Dragon book The Dragon (ALI) has woven his murdering ways from the Philippines to Australia http://t.co/c9p2ioSphM
2470,@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
2471,@SouthwestAir I've been on hold almost an hour! I LUV y'all but #ImJustSaying üòîüòîüòî http://t.co/t6fYyBHjhL
2472,@JetBlue I did.... Would be nice to see more services out of @triflight instead of having to drive 3-4 hrs to like charlotte or atlanta
2473,"@USAirways can't seem to find the pilots for our 6pm flight, never seen anything like it before #drunkpilots http://t.co/Zira2z3UDc"
2474,@JetBlue @weepysweetmonty i heard youre planning on letting people fly in the overhead compartments. why would you do that?
2475,"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
2476,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
2477,@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
2478,@united Can we get Any (free) upgrade because all the problems we've had? Our reservation is MKWLKR.
2479,@SouthwestAir I've never met my favorite band and it would be sooo amazing to win destination dragons.
2480,@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
2481,@usairways Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf
2482,@AmericanAir but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow.
2483,@USAirways We take Late Flight to a whole new level!
2484,@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
2485,@JetBlue - I look forward to getting this resolved. I will be in touch.

2488,@AmericanAir I just DMed you
2489,@USAirways Hmmm. Did the flight even really exist or did they just create it last night to get people off their backs? #usairsucks
2490,@JetBlue I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
2491,@USAirways on hold 2 hours 54 minutes. What's going on?
2492,@SouthwestAir been on hold for 30 min trying to rebook my flight you Cancelled Flightled. Help?!
2493,@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
2494,@SouthwestAir my flight is Cancelled Flightled due to weather. What next ?
2495,"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"
2496,"@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!"
2497,@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
2498,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
2499,@SouthwestAir 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous......
2500,@JetBlue my flight attendant Angel was awesome. #415 #kudos
2501,"@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra"
2502,@JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.
2503,"@AmericanAir @USAirways ""but I take meds that make me severely dehydrated"" {sigh}"
2504,"@USAirways @Sb5551 Um, WE knew this storm was coming, ? Is why didn't USeless Air?  Staff accordingly u idiots!"

2508,"@USAirways Bravo handling MSP to PHX # 2023 today. Delayed, Late Flightr Cancelled Flightled. Missed surprise 60th bday which was reason for trip.Never again"
2509,"@USAirways ur specialist said they would talk to the stewardess about not serving drunks drinks, REALLY how does that help"
2510,@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
2511,@JetBlue try harder. Take a winners attitude to your work.
2512,@USAirways flight 4524 delayed for 2 hours for a deadhead crew.  Lets make 150 paying customers wait ...that is great service #USAirways
2513,"@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
2514,@VirginAmerica is your website ever coming back online?
2515,@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
2516,"@SouthwestAir couldn't make flight, funds forfeited as a no show!! Was trying to book another flight using those funds, I'm out."
2517,@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?

2520,@SouthwestAir Hi Guys good morning how are you doing
2521,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
2522,"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
2523,@AmericanAir RDU Customer Service is awesome. Thanks! Give em all bonuses.
2524,@united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I'm worn out! #EnoughIsEnough
2525,"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
2526,@JetBlue can you ask SLC checkin/bag drop if they found a dark blue/blackish fit bit flex? Would've lost it there around 445pm MT
2527,@VirginAmerica Can I get some help with a support ticket? It's been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you!
2528,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?

2530,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
2531,@SouthwestAir  placed on hold for total of two hours today after flight was Cancelled Flightled. Online option not available. What to do?

2544,@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
2545,"@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!"
2546,@AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.

2553,@SouthwestAir you should know the crew today on flight #1071 AUS to PDX was awesome! #SWA
2554,@AmericanAir did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24?
2555,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
2556,"@AmericanAir &amp; if that wasn't enough, your staff have been so rude &amp; ignored passengers,don't think that should be accepted whatever reason"
2557,"&lt;3 &lt;3 RT @SouthwestAir! @danihampton Sorry to hear about the WiFi connection, Dani. Please DM us your conf # so we can help you. Thanks!"
2558,@JetBlue Not really. I have a flight to catch at 1 pm in Vegas. I'm praying I don't miss the flight!
2559,@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp
2560,@SouthwestAir About time...and just in time for my next flight Thursday.
2561,"@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest."
2562,@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
2563,@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
2564,@AmericanAir thanks.....
2565,@SouthwestAir have five people shown up yet
2566,@USAirways going to miss my connection because my flight home has been delayed and now no gate agent to get us off the plane-so frustrated

2569,@united they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..
2570,@SouthwestAir Why doesn't mean TSA PreCheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? My KTN is linked to my account.
2571,@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
2572,@united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me
2573,@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
2574,@USAirways why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways
2575,@SouthwestAir Thanks so much!
2576,@SouthwestAir rocks! Open letter to flight attendant. http://t.co/zFrOINPSzI  &lt
2577,@USAirways your customer service is horrible
2578,@USAirways Looking for some help to recover an item I left on an airplane this evening

2581,@SouthwestAir flt 3867 crew  #OrangeCounty to #Denver is The #BEST! Weather delay but pilots just invited the kids to see the cockpit! #luv
2582,@AmericanAir we're all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours.
2583,@SouthwestAir Me on one of your planes!!! Thanks for taking me Arizona 184! http://t.co/Finq5Fh6ue
2584,@AmericanAir they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible..
2585,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
2586,@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
2587,@USAirways thanks for letting me know of the 12 hour delay and 2 hours on hold ?
2588,@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?
2589,@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
2590,@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
2591,"But, are your flight attendants fucking tho? RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/wGYzTnjCXm"
2592,"@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait ""over 2 hours"" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?"
2593,@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
2594,@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
2595,@JetBlue does not fit in 140
2596,@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?

2598,@AmericanAir pathetic service
2599,"@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles."
2600,@SouthwestAir Bad enough that there is no seat assigned he's  seating at an exit seat and a male flight attendant removes him from there
2601,"@JetBlue hard to tell, but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane."
2602,@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?

2608,@USAirways Thanks for the information!
2609,@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
2610,@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
2611,@JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?
2612,@united Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help?
2613,@SouthwestAir had a great LA flight with Clarence and Frank! Those 2 guys are a hoot! üòúüòÇ thanks

2620,@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
2621,"@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita"
2622,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
2623,@southwestair SWEET!!! Glad to hear it. I'll keep you guys in mind next time!
2624,"@USAirways why don't you hire people to deal with the call volume, this is absolute garbage #incompetent"
2625,"@USAirways Just discovered that they billed us $300 for the rescheduled flight, which cost me a second day of lost work."
2626,Yes!! Thanks so much!!! üíú‚Äú@united: @whitterbug We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they've reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY‚Äù

2629,@AmericanAir You've now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go.
2630,"@JetBlue is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Earn Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ?"

2640,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full
2641,"@AmericanAir we then had to deplane, and change planes."
2642,@USAirways 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven't spoke to a human. Never using you again.
2643,"@SouthwestAir Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol."
2644,@JetBlue thanks for the info... Figured that was the case. Hopefully my new hashtag will change that 
2645,@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
2646,@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
2647,@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!
2648,"@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?"
2649,@USAirways 1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management
2650,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
2651,@USAirways I'm trying to merge my freq flyer accts but keep getting an error message and only a machine when calling the # provided. Help!
2652,@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919.
2653,@JetBlue That's great! Thank you.
2654,@USAirways üòÇ. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour.
2655,@AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble
2656,@USAirways delays to the max
2657,"@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled, leaving tomorrow morning. Auto rebooked for a Tuesday night flight but need to arrive Monday."

2659,@SouthwestAir best airline üëå
2660,@USAirways That link doesn't work on mobile.
2661,@AmericanAir  terrible response! How about someone picking up the phone and calling me...It is now 49 Hours with no luggage

2663,"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
2664,"@JetBlue I'm not sure if you can do anything to help me with that, but if you can that'd be great."
2665,"@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff"
2666,"@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim"
2667,@USAirways never received such horrible service or treated so poorly as Richard P. today. No excuse for attitude &amp
2668,@SouthwestAir been waiting for 70 minutes on hold because yall Cancelled Flightled my return flight. Answer the phone!!!
2669,"@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
2670,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
2671,@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.

2698,@JetBlue what's good with a Miami terminal?
2699,@JetBlue I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights
2700,"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
2701,@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail

2726,@VirginAmerica wow this just blew my mind
2727,@USAirways nothing like back to back delayed flights let hope this one isn't 12 hours like the last time.
2728,@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
2729,"@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire"
2730,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)

2741,@united @paigeworthy : page United values your tweet b/c it's so rare that they receive tweets complimenting their service...most are fake.
2742,@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
2743,@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
2744,@JetBlue we are bringing 2 guitars. can we bring them as carry on?
2745,@JetBlue OH YEAH!!! great flight down to Mexico with a wonderful crew!! Thank you!!

2752,@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
2753,@USAirways CSTSVC in PHL honors UR system over my reality. No RCD of change in HPN. Now extra hours in PHL or $75 to get to CLE.
2754,@USAirways that is certainly not the impression she's under.

2766,@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
2767,@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
2768,@southwestair Winter Weather for Denver extended for tomorrow by chance? Even to Late Flightr in the day would be super helpful.

2784,@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
2785,@AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
2786,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
2787,@JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
2788,@SouthwestAir I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds.

2802,@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
2803,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
2804,@USAirways Why haven't you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow.

2813,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds

2867,"@USAirways I sympathize re:weather issues, but when times get tough, call in more folks. Over two hours on hold for 4-minute fix. #FAIL"
2868,@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?

2882,@SouthwestAir Thanks to your team for dealing with Flight 1700 to Houston.
2883,@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
2884,@AmericanAir so how do we get me a person?
2885,@AmericanAir anything in particular I should ask for.   Will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
2886,@USAirways owes Tammy from the Winston-Salem call center for keeping me as a customer!
2887,@SouthwestAir #delayed again! You're killing me Late Flightly!
2888,@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.
2889,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
2890,"@united that's what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!!"
2891,"@SouthwestAir Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can't find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE."
2892,@SouthwestAir @SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok.
2893,"@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable."
2894,@USAirways thanks Travis at PHL A East checkin for knowing baggage policies. Skis &amp
2895,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
2896,@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something

3064,"@united your website won't allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties**"
3065,@SouthwestAir Suggestions: tell customers approximate wait times when they are on hold (50 min now...) and allow them to Cancelled Flight online!
3066,@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
3067,@USAirways 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV
3068,@SouthwestAir when you enter every contest for #DestinationDragons and lose :(
3069,"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
